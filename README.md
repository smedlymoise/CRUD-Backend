# CRUD Backend

## Getting Started

This project uses Express.js to serve up an API server, and Sequelize to connect to a PostgreSQL database. You should start by forking or cloning this repo, and then adding your teammates as collaborators.

You will also need to create the database: by default it is called ttp_crud, but you are welcome to rename it in `database/db.js`

After that, you can get started with these commands

```
npm install # ðŸ“¦ To install the packages
npm run seed # ðŸŒ± To seed the database
npm run start-dev # ðŸš€ To start the server in development mode
```

This project runs in the Node.js runtime environment. We're not using Webpack here, but we are using a tool called nodemon, which re-runs our app whenever we save a file. You should see a message in the terminal telling you that the server is running on port 8080.

When an error occurs on the backend (Express), you'll see a message in the terminal. When an error occurs on the frontend (React), you'll see that error in the browser.

## Deployment

This project has a vercel.json file, which will make it easier to deploy this project to Vercel. Check the video listed in the cohort repository for a walkthrough of how to connect your deployed Express server to Neon Postgres.
